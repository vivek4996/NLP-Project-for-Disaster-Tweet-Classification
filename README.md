# NLP-Project-for-Disaster-Tweet-Classification

Twitter has becoTwitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency theyâ€™re observing in real-time.
Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

Classification Model Development: Develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a tweet is about a real disaster or not. Accuracy and Precision: Aim for high accuracy and precision in classification to minimize false alarms and ensure timely and accurate disaster detection. Robustness: Create a model that can handle variations in language, including slang, abbreviations, and cultural nuances, to ensure effectiveness across diverse tweet datasets. Scalability: Build a scalable solution capable of processing large volumes of tweets in real-time to support continuous monitoring efforts
